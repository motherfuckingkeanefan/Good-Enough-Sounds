        <h2>Good Enough Sounds</h2>

        <p>Field recording can feel overwhelming. There’s always more to learn, better gear to buy, and a voice in your head telling you the recording isn’t good enough. That voice kept me from starting for a long time.</p>

        <p>Good Enough Sounds is about getting past that. It’s a personal project where I focus on recording sound as it happens—without worrying about perfection. No endless tweaking, no waiting for ideal conditions. Just pressing record and listening.</p>

        <h3>What This Project Is About</h3>
        <p>I live near Katwijk aan Zee in the Netherlands, where I record waves, wind, birds, and other natural soundscapes. The ocean, dunes, and changing seasons make for an unpredictable and evolving environment. Some recordings turn out well. Others have unexpected noise, mistakes, or distractions. That’s part of it.</p>

        <h3>What You’ll Find Here</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Recordings of the Dutch coast, dunes, and natural environments</li>
            <li>Notes on location, weather, and recording conditions</li>
            <li>Experiments with different microphone techniques</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This site is not a technical guide or a collection of perfect recordings. It’s a way to document and share sound as I experience it. If you’re interested in field recording, or just curious about how the world sounds, take a look around.</p>
