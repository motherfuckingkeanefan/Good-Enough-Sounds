      Welcome to my diary where I share my adventures in field recording, my battles with perfectionism, and the raw, beautiful moments I capture along the way.

      <h2>Field Recording at Strand Wassenaarseslag: Capturing Waves and Foam</h2>

      <p>
        Today’s session at Strand Wassenaarseslag was all about the sea. Before I began, I couldn’t help but worry that the strong tide and gusty wind might tip my tripod over—perhaps adding some weight to it would have been wise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The atmosphere was quiet and reflective. I arranged my usual rig—a Zoom F3 paired with Line Audio CM4 mics in an ORTF setup on my Manfrotto 5001B Nano Stand—and upgraded to the new Movo WST50 Ballistic Nylon Windscreens, which performed significantly better than my old WS8 Rode windscreens.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had some ideas to improve the setup: perhaps adding a hook to properly attach my headphones to the tripod when not in use. This could help prevent the headphones from moving in the wind and causing extra noise. I even considered a setup where you could listen to the sound from about 5-10 meters away—though I’m still figuring out the details. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The sound of the waves was constant and compelling—the deep, rolling rhythm of the ocean paired with the delicate hiss of foam breaking on the sand. Even as a light rain began, the sea maintained its steady song. 
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        After about 45 minutes of recording, I sat on the damp sand, absorbing the pure sound of the sea. This session reminded me that letting go of perfection is essential; sometimes the simplest elements—the rolling waves and shifting foam—offer the most genuine, unedited moments. It was a peaceful day that reinforced my goal of capturing real sound, raw and unpolished.

      <h2>Field Recording at Landje van Bremmer: Practical Challenges &amp; Clear Insights</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on March 6, 2025</p>
      <!-- Article Text -->
      <p>
        Today I headed to Landje van Bremmer for my very first field recording session, and I loved every moment of it. Reaching the spot required hopping a fence—yes, I even had to dodge a potential run-in with an upset farmer. The field was a bit muddy, and a few curious sheep were around, making the experience both practical and unexpectedly interesting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A quick note from the session: it might be a good idea not to wear jeans while recording, as the wet, slightly soggy conditions in the field can be uncomfortable. I was a bit worried about the wind as well, but in post production, the High Pass filter worked perfectly in eliminating the low wind noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weather was favorable with a gentle sun and a mild breeze, although I kept an eye on my rig to avoid unwanted wind noise. I set up my usual gear: a Zoom F3 recorder paired with Line Audio CM4 mics in an ORTF configuration, all mounted on my Manfrotto 5001B Nano Stand, and for this session, I used the WS8 Rode windscreens.
      </p>

      <p>
        The soundscape featured clear honks from geese, a steady rustle of reeds, and ambient natural sounds that provided a balanced background. I made a few light edits to trim minor issues, but I purposefully embraced every unexpected, imperfect moment—a reminder that striving for perfection only obscures the beauty of real sound. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, this session served as a practical exercise in managing unpredictable outdoor conditions while battling my own urge for perfection. It reinforced that field recording is about capturing real moments—even if they aren’t flawless.
