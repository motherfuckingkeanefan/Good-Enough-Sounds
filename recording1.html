            <h3>Location and Conditions</h3>
            <p>Recorded at Katwijk aan Zee, a coastal town in the Netherlands known for its open beaches and shifting tides. The conditions were mild, with an overcast sky and a light breeze coming in from the northwest.</p>

            <h3>Recording Setup</h3>
            <p>The microphones were placed in ORTF configuration on a K&M stereo bar, positioned close to the waterline but far enough to avoid splashes. No wind protection was used as conditions were stable.</p>

            <h3>Observations</h3>
            <p>This was recorded just before sunset, when the tide was rising. The waves were steady, breaking at a predictable rhythm. A few distant seagulls can be heard, but overall, this was a quiet moment on the beach.</p>
            <p>The lack of strong wind helped keep the recording clean. The only interruptions were a few walkers passing by in the distance. No post-processing was applied.</p>
