        <h3>Location and Conditions</h3>
        <p>
          Getting to the spot was an adventure in itself—I had to hop a fence, half-expecting an angry farmer to chase me off his land. The field was a little muddy, but nothing too bad. The sheep were surprisingly curious about me, probably wondering what this weird human with all the gear was up to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weather? Absolutely perfect. Just the right balance of sun and breeze. Though, I did have some worries about wind noise creeping into the recording. The setup took a bit of adjusting, making sure my rig wouldn’t get knocked over or pick up too much interference.

        <h3>Recording Setup</h3>
        <p>
          My setup was simple but solid: a Zoom F3 paired with Line Audio CM4 microphones in an ORTF configuration. Mounted on a Manfrotto 5001B Nano Stand, it held up well, though I kept a nervous eye on it whenever the wind picked up. Rode WS8 windscreens helped, but I could still hear some gusts making their way into the recording.

        <h3>Observations</h3>
        <p>
          The geese were, of course, the loudest voices in the mix. But in between their honking battles, there were some softer, more subtle nature sounds peeking through. The reeds swayed, the distant hum of life carried on, and occasionally, a gust of wind added its own texture.

          I did some light editing—just a trim here and there—but I’m learning to embrace the imperfections. If the wind picks up or a rogue sheep makes a surprise appearance, so be it. That’s the beauty of field recording. This experience was wonderful, and I can’t wait for the next one.
