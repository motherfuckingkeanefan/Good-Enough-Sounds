      <section class="recording-section">
        <h3>Location and Conditions</h3>
        <p>
          Landje van Bremmer is a small but ecologically valuable nature area near Wassenaar. Think of it as nature’s playground—wildflowers, insects, and a few too many geese. The soil’s got this perfect balance of not too much human interference, but still a bit of TLC from conservation efforts (no wild parties here, just nature doing its thing). During my session, the only interruption was the enthusiastic chorus of geese and the occasional wind rustling through the reeds.

        <h3>Recording Setup</h3>
        <p>
          Here it is, my first-ever field recording. The setup was nothing too fancy—just my trusty Zoom F3 paired with Line Audio CM4 microphones in ORTF (I didn’t want to overdo it, I mean, it’s my first time). I mounted everything on a Manfrotto 5001B Nano Stand. The wind wasn’t too crazy, but just to be safe, I slapped on my Rode WS8 windscreens. They held up—mostly. The wind gusts definitely had their say though.

        <h3>Observations</h3>
        <p>
          As expected, the geese took the spotlight, honking and making all kinds of noise while the reeds quietly swayed. There was a lot of wind, a lot of honking, and a few softer sounds from nature sneaking in between. I didn’t mind—I love the chaos that comes with recording in the wild.

          I trimmed a tiny bit out of the 1-hour recording (still figuring out editing), but I’ve learned that this journey is about embracing the messiness. If the wind’s blowing, the geese are fighting, or a truck drives by, it’s all part of the story. And that’s what keeps me recording.
