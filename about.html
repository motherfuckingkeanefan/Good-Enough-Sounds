      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Pieter. I started <strong>Good Enough Sounds</strong> as a way to stop overthinking and
        just start recording. Because if we wait for the perfect moment, we’ll be waiting until the universe runs out of cosmic gas.

        <h3>The Problem with Perfection</h3>
        <p>
          Like many beginners, I spent more time reading gear reviews than actually pressing “Record.” I was convinced I needed a microphone blessed by angels, a noise-free environment, and the perfect alignment of the stars. But guess what? Waiting for all that basically means never recording at all.

        <h3>Recording Without Fear</h3>
        <p>
          This project is about embracing imperfection—if there’s a gust of wind, a random bird cameo, or a passing ice-cream truck, it’s all part of the story. No over-polishing, no editing out reality, just documenting life as it unfolds.

        <h3>Where I Record</h3>
        <p>
          Most of my recordings happen around <strong>Katwijk aan Zee</strong>, a coastal town in the Netherlands. Between the crashing waves, windy dunes, and the occasional grumpy seagull, there’s never a dull sonic moment. I also wander into wetlands and rural areas for that fresh “cow-mooing-in-the-distance” ambiance.

      <section>
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          My philosophy? Keep it simple. I use reliable gear, minimal post-processing, and a hearty dose of “Let’s see what happens.” Because real life is messy, but that’s what makes it interesting.
