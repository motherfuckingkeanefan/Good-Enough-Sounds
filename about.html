        <h2>About This Project</h2>
      </header>
      <p>My name is Pieter Houtekamer. I started <strong>Good Enough Sounds</strong> as a way to stop overthinking and start recording.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>The Problem with Perfection</h3>
        <p>Like many beginners, I spent more time researching field recording than actually doing it. I convinced myself that I needed better gear, more knowledge, and the perfect conditions before I could start. But waiting for perfection meant never recording at all.</p>

        <h3>Recording Without Fear</h3>
        <p>This project is about embracing imperfection. Instead of chasing flawless recordings, I focus on capturing sound as it happens—wind, background noise, and all. The goal is to document reality, not edit it.</p>

        <h3>Where I Record</h3>
        <p>Most of my recordings are made around <strong>Katwijk aan Zee</strong>, a coastal town in the Netherlands. The sea, dunes, and changing weather provide an unpredictable soundscape. I also record in nearby wetlands and quiet rural areas.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>I use simple, reliable equipment and minimal post-processing. The point isn’t to make perfect recordings—it’s to capture what I hear, when I hear it.</p>
      </section>
      <p>Good Enough Sounds is a personal project, but I hope it resonates with others interested in sound, field recording, or just getting past perfectionism.</p>
