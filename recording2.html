            <h3>Location and Conditions</h3>
            <p>Recorded in the dunes near Katwijk, a quiet natural area with open grasslands and small patches of forest. The morning was clear, and the temperature was low, creating crisp, natural acoustics.</p>

            <h3>Recording Setup</h3>
            <p>The microphones were set in ORTF configuration and placed at a slight elevation to capture the open soundscape. The location was chosen for its distance from human activity, allowing for an undisturbed morning chorus.</p>

            <h3>Observations</h3>
            <p>The early morning conditions allowed for a natural and balanced recording of bird activity. The blackbirds and finches were most prominent, with occasional calls from crows in the background.</p>
            <p>The absence of wind made for a clean recording, with only subtle environmental noise from distant trees. This session highlights the dynamic changes in bird activity as the sun rises.</p>
